**Vehicle Number Plate Detection**

Vehicle Number Plate Detection is a project that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and extract license plates from static images. It provides an automated system for identifying vehicle number plates, which can be useful in various applications such as surveillance, traffic management, and law enforcement.

**Features**
Detects and extracts license plates from static images.
Applies image preprocessing techniques to enhance the accuracy of license plate detection.
Utilizes edge detection algorithms for identifying potential edges of license plates.
Performs contour detection to locate and isolate the license plate regions.
Applies optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to recognize the characters on the license plate.
Supports popular image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

**Installation**
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Prem3501/Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection.git

Run the main script:


**python main.py**
The detected license plates will be saved in the output_images directory, along with the recognized characters (if applicable).
